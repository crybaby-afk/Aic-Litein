# assets/src

This folder is the *source* area for high-resolution / original photos (master files).

Usage:
- Drop original RAW / high-res photos here, e.g. `youth-raw.psd` or `children-raw.jpg`.
- Do not commit extremely large binaries if your repository limits storage — keep local copies if needed.
- When ready, add optimized copies (resized, compressed, and web-friendly) to `assets/images/`.

Naming guideline (recommended):
- Use lowercase, hyphen-separated names (e.g. `youth-event-2025.jpg`).
- Keep basic semantic names so HTML references are predictable.

If you'd like, I can also add an image optimization step to produce `assets/images/` versions automatically.
